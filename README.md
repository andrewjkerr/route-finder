route-finder
============

A program written in C++ to find either the shortest or quickest route based on user input! It takes in two csv files, one of cities and another of routes, and then uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the cheapest or fastest route between the origin and the destination. The program only uses command line arguments and does not have a menu. You can run the program like this:

./Project4 cities.csv routes.csv htmlOutputName.html Origin Destination choice
(Note: choice is either 'cheapest' or 'fastest'.)

You can compile the program by cloning this repository and just running 'make' in the cloned directory.
